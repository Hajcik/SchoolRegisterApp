# Development opportunities

Repository is archivized becasue application wasn't in development since it's latest release in June 2020, and support for .NET Core 2.1 ends in August 2021.
<br /><br />
Application is fully functional, but it can be improved in many ways. Application backend is safe, but it would be best if it was redesigned from ground up to be more secure, as developer improved in making .NET applications during following years. 
<br /><br />
School Register would benefit from improving the aesthetics and ensuring the localization is correct on every page. Chat can be improved by saving messages between users, currently messages disappear after refreshing the Chat page.
